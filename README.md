The Yield : Weather Application
===============

The weather application is a simple web application to display current weather and 5 day forecast for two cities - Sydney, NSW and Hobart, Tasmania. The weather data is fetched by web service calls to http://openweathermap.org/api. 

## Endpoints:
* To fetch current weather details the call is made to the endpoint http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=6619279&APPID=003eb7a7d55b82788dbe5f66b766688f&units=metric where "id" is the city id (the value above is for Syndey), the "APPID" is the token generated by signing up to their service and "units" is the unit of measurement (celsius in the example).
* To fetch 5 day forecast the call is first made to the endpoint http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?id=6619279&APPID=003eb7a7d55b82788dbe5f66b766688f&units=metric where the parameters are the same as before. Once the response is decoded, the true minimum and maximum temperature for a day is extracted logically by looping.

This application demonstrates:

* A web application that consumes a third party weather api
* Using ASP.NET MVC 5 a clear separation between the service layer and the web tier is maintained

```id:6619279

units:metric
```

## Requirements:

* Visual Studio 2015 installed

## Limitations:

* The validity of longitude and latitude of the 3rd party API has not been verified against a relaible source. Google Maps shows slightly different values.
* There can be only 60 calls made in a 5 minute window.
